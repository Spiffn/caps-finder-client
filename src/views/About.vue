              President has many alternative names: Scum, Asshole (in Britain: Arsehole),
              Rich Man Poor Man, Bum, Landlord, Emperors and Scum, Root Beer, Butthead,
              Capitalism. In Australia it is often called Warlords and Scumbags, perhaps
              because the politician Paul Keating once famously used the word "scumbag"
              to describe his opponents. In France it is Trouduc or Trou du Cul;
              in Germany: Einer ist immer der Arsch; in Hungary it is Hűbéres (vassal);
              in the Netherlands it is Sluitspieren or Klootzakken.

              The game has recently spread throughout the Western world,
              especially among young people, but is probably of Chinese origin.
              In games of this type (which I call climbing games),
              each player in turn can either pass or play a card or combination
              which beats the previous play, and the usual object is to get
              rid of all one's cards as soon as possible.
              Such games have been known in the West only since the 1970's,
              but there are many of them in China,
              perhaps the most famous being Zheng Shangyou.
              The immediate ancestor of President is perhaps the
              Japanese game Dai Hin Min.

              As the game has spread, numerous variations have developed.
              I will describe a typical basic version first,
              and list some variations at the end. As the variations
              are so numerous, I have tried to group them into types
              for easier reference.
